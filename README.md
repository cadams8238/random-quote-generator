# Random Quote Generator

See live project here --> http://languid-wing.surge.sh

I created this project to help me learn how to build with React. It's a responsive quote generator that shows a new quote and background image when the "show another" button is pressed. I wanted to solidify my understanding of how to utilize state within React without the addition of added libraries. An added challenge was learning how to fetch async data from third party APIs.
